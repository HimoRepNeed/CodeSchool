## 1.2 Database Usage

What are databases used for?

```
Databases collect and organize information for easy retrieval.
```

## 1.3 Services

Which of the following services might use a database?

```
Email, GPS, Facebook, Twitter
All of the above

## 1.4 Tables

Gatsby Theaters

movies        | showtimes
------------- | -------------
concessions   | promotions

In order to look up information on Promo Codes and Coupons, we would need to go into the Gatsby Theaters database and look inside the 
`promotions`
Correct table.

## 1.5 Table Structure

A database is composed of 
`table`
Correct , where columns and rows store the actual data.

## 1.6 Horizontal Elements

The horizontally organized elements of a table are called rows. 

id  | title | genre | duration
--- | --- | --- | --- 
1	| Metropolis | Sci-Fi | 153
2	| Nosferatu | Horror | 94

## 1.11 SQL Interaction

SQL is a programming language that allows interaction with a 
`database`
Correct  on a server.

## 1.12 All Rows

The following SQL code will help us find all of the rows in the table `movies`.

```
SELECT id, title, genre, duration
FROM movies;
```

id  | title | genre | duration
--- | --- | --- | --- 
1	| Metropolis | Sci-Fi | 153
2	| Nosferatu | Horror | 94
3	| The Kid | Comedy | 68
4	| The Gold Rush | Adventure | 95

```
TRUE
```

## 1.13 Only Genre

The following SQL code will help us find all records for only the column of genre in the table `movies`.

```
SELECT * FROM movies;
```

```
FALSE
```

## 1.14 Fix SELECT

Have a look at the table below, and then correct the SQL in the editor on the right according to the written objectives. 

id  | title | genre | duration
--- | --- | --- | --- 
1	| Metropolis | Sci-Fi | 153
2	| Nosferatu | Horror | 94
3	| The Kid | Comedy | 68
4	| The Gold Rush | Adventure | 95

The following SQL statement has an error. Fix the query so that it will return the id and title of all movies.

```
SELECT id, title FROM movies;
```

## 1.15 Filtering Data

The 
`WHERE`
Correct  clause can be used to filter data within a `SELECT` statement.

## 1.16 Introducing SELECT

Write a SQL query to retrieve all movies that are currently showing. The name of the table shown below is `movies`. 

id  | title | genre | duration
--- | --- | --- | --- 
1	| Metropolis | Sci-Fi | 153
2	| Nosferatu | Horror | 94
3	| The Kid | Comedy | 68
4	| The Gold Rush | Adventure | 95

1. Write a SQL query to retrieve all films that are currently showing.
2. Great, â€“ now add a filter to only show `'Adventure'` films.
3. Lastly, modify the query to only return the **title** and **duration** of the `'Adventure'` films.

```
Select title, duration From movies Where genre='Adventure';
```

## 1.17 Record Count

How many records will the following query return?

```
SELECT title, duration 
FROM movies 
WHERE title = 'The Lone Ranger';
```

id  | title | genre | duration
--- | --- | --- | --- 
1	| Metropolis | Sci-Fi | 153
2	| Nosferatu | Horror | 94
3	| The Kid | Comedy | 68
4	| The Gold Rush | Adventure | 95

```
0
```

## 1.18 Returning Title

Let's start writing some queries to return specific columns. The name of the table shown below is `movies`. 

id  | title | genre | duration
--- | --- | --- | --- 
1	| Metropolis | Sci-Fi | 153
2	| Nosferatu | Horror | 94
3	| The Kid | Comedy | 68
4	| The Gold Rush | Adventure | 95

1. Return the title of all results from the `movies` table.
2. Filter the result set by the **genre** of `'Sci-Fi'`.

```
SELECT title FROM movies WHERE genre='Sci-Fi';
```

## 1.19 Guiding Data Criteria

## 1.20 Sorting Data

To sort data, you must use the 
`ORDER BY`
Correct  clause.

## 1.21 ORDER BY

Fill in the blank below: When we query for `movies` ordered by genre, we see the listings in descending order (from Z to A)

```
SELECT * FROM movies ORDER BY genre _______;
```

```
DESC
```

## 1.22 Which Rows

Select all matching rows that would be included in the results of the following query:

```
SELECT * 
FROM  movies
WHERE duration >= 90;
```

id | title | duration | genre
--- | --- | --- | --- 
1 | Metropolis | 153 | Sci-Fi
2 | Nosferatu | 	94 | Horror
4 | The Gold Rush | 95 | Adventure

## 1.23 Except Metropolis

Which rows would be included in the results of the following query:

```
SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE title <> 'Metropolis';
```

id | title | duration | genre
--- | --- | --- | --- 
2 | Nosferatu	 | 94 | Horror
3 | The Kid | 68 | Comedy
4 | The Gold Rush | 95 | Adventure
5 | The Circus | 71 | Comedy

## 1.24 SELECT by ID AND Title

Which rows would be included in the results of the following query:

```
SELECT * 
FROM movies
WHERE id = 2
AND title = 'Nosferatu';
```

id | title | duration | genre
--- | --- | --- | --- 
2 | Nosferatu	 | 94 | Horror

## 1.25 Two Conditionals

By joining two or more conditionals with 
`AND`
Correct , we can refine our query.

## 1.26 Returning Title With OR

Which rows would be included in the results of the following query:

```
SELECT title
FROM movies
WHERE id = 2
OR genre = 'Adventure';
```

id | title | duration | genre
--- | --- | --- | --- 
2 | Nosferatu	 | 94 | Horror
4 | The Gold Rush | 95 | Adventure

## 1.27 Adjusting SELECT

It is time to write some more advanced `SELECT` statements. The name of the table shown below is `movies`. 

id  | title | genre | duration
--- | --- | --- | --- 
1	| Metropolis | Sci-Fi | 153
2	| Nosferatu | Horror | 94
3	| The Kid | Comedy | 68
4	| The Gold Rush | Adventure | 95
5	| Wolf Blood | Horror | 86

1. Generate a query that only returns the id and **title** of movies with a **duration** greater than or equal to `86`.
2. Now, sort the results by their `duration` in ascending order.
3. Finally, only return records with **genre** of `'Horror'`.

```
SELECT id,title FROM movies WHERE genre='Horror' AND duration >= 86 ORDER BY duration;
```

## 1.28 Adding to SELECT

Based on the new table below named `concessions`, please complete the following tasks.

id | item | price | size
--- | --- | --- | --- 
1 | Popcorn | 2.00 | Small
2 | Popcorn | 4.00 | Large
3 | Candy | 3.00 | Regular
4 | Soda | 1.50 | Small
5 | Soda | 2.50 | Large
6 | Hot Dog | 2.00 | Regular

1. Write a query to find the **item**, **price**, and **size** for all items that are `'Popcorn'`.
2. Add to your query, but this time order the results by **price** starting with the most expensive at the top.
3. Change the query to list items that are either `'Soda'` or `'Popcorn'`.

```
SELECT item, price, size FROM concessions WHERE item = 'Popcorn' OR item = 'Soda' ORDER BY price DESC;
```
